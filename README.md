Prediction of corona disease using X-Ray of chest

This dataset is created by merging data from different sources.
create_dataset.ipynb file create dataset by merging data from varios sources.

Here, I used transfer learning for prediction you can create your own model and train it using this dataset. But, I think this dataset is not big enough to train own model that's why I used transfer learning.
